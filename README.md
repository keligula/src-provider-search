# SRM Provider Search

---

This is a search page prototype that renders a list of Doctors and Hospitals based off the user's search input, which in turn queries a test dataset.

This application uses React on the front end, reactstrap for styling, react-avatar for avatar creation, and jest and enzyme for testing purposes.

To run locally:

```
npm install
npm start
```
